# ytt Workshop and References

This repository contains several ytt workshops and references for getting started with ytt as a templating tool.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with the workshops, you must have the following:

- ytt CLI installed
- kapp CLI installed
- imgpkg CLI installed
- Tanzu CLI installed
- kubectl CLI installed
- Access to a Tanzu Kubernetes cluster

Note: since ytt, kapp and imgpkg are all part of the Carvel suite, it may be easier for you to install the entire [Carvel suite](https://carvel.dev/#install).

## Workshops

[Workshop 1 - Using ytt with a Basic YAML](./1-ytt-basic-yaml)

[Workshop 2 - Using ytt with a Kubernetes Manifest](./2-ytt-k8s-app)
