# ytt Workshop and References

This repository contains several ytt workshops and references for getting started with ytt as a templating tool.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with the workshops, you must have the following:

- ytt CLI installed
- kapp CLI installed
- imgpkg CLI installed
- kubectl CLI installed
- Access to a Tanzu Kubernetes cluster

Note: since ytt, kapp and imgpkg are all part of the Carvel suite, it may be easier for you to install the entire [Carvel suite](https://carvel.dev/#install).
